<p>I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://cds.nyu.edu/">CDS</a> at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/">NYU</a>, where I am advised by <a href="https://tallinzen.net/">Tal Linzen</a> and supported by an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/resources/about-grfp/">NSF graduate research fellowship</a> and by <a href="https://allenai.org/">AI2</a>.</p>

<p>My research develops theory to better understand what <b>language models</b> can do, as well as what they can't. I've worked on characterizing the <b>computational power of transformers</b> for representing linguistic structure and solving reasoning problems. I've also analyzed the aspects of <b>semantics that can be learned from co-occurrence patterns</b> as a way to understand the potential of self-supervised learning.</p>

<p>Outside of research, I like exploring New York City by foot, train, and boat. I like cooking new things and trying hole-in-the-wall restaurants. I also play basketball, ping pong, and Age of Empires II.</p>
