original Old English <a href="http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&amp;type=text&amp;id=wdr" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p> <p>Often the outcast<br> awaits his grace,<br> the Lord’s mercy,<br> though he, sorrow-minded,<br> must turn his oars<br> along the waters,<br> wade the path of exile.<br> Fate goes always as it must!</p> <p>So spoke the earth-stepper,<br> mindful of his misfortunes,<br> of wrathful slaughter,<br> the death of his comrades:</p> <p>Often in the morning,<br> I had to discuss<br> my every trouble alone.<br> There is no one living<br> that I dare open my innermost thought to.<br> Truly I know<br> that it ought to be among men,<br> the noble custom,<br> where one secures the chest of his spirit,<br> hordes his treasure case,<br> thinks and speaks freely.<br> The weary spirit cannot<br> withstand fate,<br> nor does the bitter mind<br> help do any good.<br> So the glory-yearning<br> often lock away their dreary<br> thoughts in their breast-coffins.<br> So I,<br> often wretched<br> and besorrowed,<br> have had to seal away<br> my thoughts from kinsmen,<br> since, long ago,<br> I sealed my lord<br> in the darkness of the earth<br> and from there travelled<br> winter-minded<br> over the frozen waves,<br> sought, hall-lacking,<br> a treasure-giver,<br> wherever far or near<br> I might find someone<br> in the meadhall<br> who knew me,<br> or was willing to console<br> me, the friendless one,<br> wow me with wonders.</p> <p>He who has known it understands<br> how cruel sorrow is as a companion<br> for the one who has<br> few beloved friends.<br> Exile wraps him,<br> not rings of gold,<br> a frozen spirit,<br> not the prosperity of the earth.<br> He remembers hall-warriors<br> and ring-givers,<br> how his gold-giver<br> treated him to feasting<br> in his youth.<br> How all that joy has died!<br> And so he knows this,<br> he who must for a long time<br> forgo the counsel of his<br> dear lord,<br> when sorrow and sleep together<br> wrap him up and bind him.<br> He dreams in his head<br> that he hugs and kisses<br> his lord,<br> and on his lord’s knee<br> lie his hand and head,<br> just as he, at times<br> in days gone by,<br> enjoyed the gift throne.<br> Then he wakes back up<br> a lordless man,<br> he sees before him<br> dusky waves,<br> sea birds bathing,<br> pruning their feathers,<br> frost and snow falling,<br> mixed in with hail.<br> Then are that much heavier<br> the wounds of his heart,<br> grieving after his lord.<br> His sorrow is renewed<br> when his mind happens upon<br> the memory of his kinsmen.<br> He greets them with joy,<br> eagerly looks over<br> the gathering of men -<br> but they always swim away.<br> The journey of sailors<br> never brings back many<br> known stories.<br> Grief is renewed<br> for him who must<br> always send his<br> weary heart<br> over the binding of the waves.</p> <p>Therefore I can’t think<br> why my heart does not<br> darken when I reflect<br> on all the lives of men<br> throughout this world,<br> how they suddenly<br> left the hall floor,<br> those proud thanes.<br> So each day this Middle Earth<br> crumbles and decays.<br> Therefore a man cannot become<br> wise before he has a share<br> of winters in the world.<br> A wise man must be patient,<br> must not be too reckless,<br> nor too word-hasty<br> nor too weak a warrior,<br> nor too rash,<br> neither too fearful nor cheerful,<br> nor too greedy of goods,<br> and never too eager for boasting<br> before he truly understands.<br> A man must wait<br> when he speaks oaths<br> until the bold one<br> truly knows<br> where his heart’s intent<br> will turn.<br> A wise hero must realize<br> how ghastly it will be<br> when all the wealth of this world<br> lies waste,<br> as now in various places<br> around this earth,<br> walls stand<br> blown by wind,<br> covered in snow,<br> storm-wrecked ruins.<br> The halls decay,<br> their leader lies dead,<br> deprived of joy.<br> The whole troop<br> has proudly fallen by the wall.<br> Some war took them,<br> carried them on their way.<br> One, a bird snatched off<br> over the deep sea.<br> Another, the grey wolf<br> tore apart after his death.<br> Another, buried<br> dreary-faced<br> in his grave.<br> And so He destroyed this place,<br> the Creator of men,<br> until missing the noise<br> of its residents,<br> the old work of giants<br> stood idle.</p> <p>He who wisely reflected<br> on this ruin,<br> and deeply pondered<br> this dark life,<br> wise in experience,<br> distantly remembered<br> much slaying,<br> and spoke these words:</p> <p>Where is the horse? Where is the rider?<br> Where is the treasure-giver?<br> Where are the hall’s joys?<br> Alas, the bright cups!<br> Alas, the warrior in mail!<br> How that time has departed,<br> dark under night’s helm,<br> as if it never were.<br> Now stands as a trace of<br> the dear warband<br> a wonderously high wall,<br> snakingly woven.<br> The warriors have been snatched away<br> by the honor of spears,<br> slaughter-seeking weapons,<br> that famous fate,<br> and storms clash against<br> these stone cliffs,<br> falling frost<br> grips the earth,<br> the clamor of winter.<br> Then darkness comes;<br> night’s shadow deepens.<br> From the north approaches<br> a rough hail storm,<br> hostile to men.<br> All is troubled<br> in this earthly kingdom,<br> the tide of fate<br> turns the world under the heavens.<br> Here is wealth fleeting.<br> Here are companions fleeting.<br> Here is man himself fleeting.<br> Here is kinsman fleeting.<br> Every foundation of this world<br> becomes void and vain.</p> <p>So spoke the wise one in his mind.<br> He sat apart in thought.<br> Good is he who holds onto his faith,<br> and a warrior must never speak<br> the grievances of his heart too quickly,<br> unless he already knows the cure.<br> A hero must act with conviction.<br> Good is he who seeks mercy,<br> the Father’s grace in Heaven,<br> where permanence stands for us all.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 William Merrill.
