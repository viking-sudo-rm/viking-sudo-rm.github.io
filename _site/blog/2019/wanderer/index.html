        <p>My amateur translation of the Old English poem</p>
      </d-title>

      <d-byline></d-byline>

      <d-article>
        

        <p><em>You can find the original Old English <a href="http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&amp;type=text&amp;id=wdr" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Often the outcast<br>
awaits his grace,<br>
the Lord’s mercy,<br>
though he, sorrow-minded,<br>
must turn his oars<br>
along the waters,<br>
wade the path of exile.<br>
Fate goes always as it must!</p>

<p>So spoke the earth-stepper,<br>
mindful of his misfortunes,<br>
of wrathful slaughter,<br>
the death of his comrades:</p>

<p>Often in the morning,<br>
I had to discuss<br>
my every trouble alone.<br>
There is no one living<br>
that I dare open my innermost thought to.<br>
Truly I know<br>
that it ought to be among men,<br>
the noble custom,<br>
where one secures the chest of his spirit,<br>
hordes his treasure case,<br>
thinks and speaks freely.<br>
The weary spirit cannot<br>
withstand fate,<br>
nor does the bitter mind<br>
help do any good.<br>
So the glory-yearning<br>
often lock away their dreary<br>
thoughts in their breast-coffins.<br>
So I,<br>
often wretched<br>
and besorrowed,<br>
have had to seal away<br>
my thoughts from kinsmen,<br>
since, long ago,<br>
I sealed my lord<br>
in the darkness of the earth<br>
and from there travelled<br>
winter-minded<br>
over the frozen waves,<br>
sought, hall-lacking,<br>
a treasure-giver,<br>
wherever far or near<br>
I might find someone<br>
in the meadhall<br>
who knew me,<br>
or was willing to console<br>
me, the friendless one,<br>
wow me with wonders.</p>

<p>He who has known it understands<br>
how cruel sorrow is as a companion<br>
for the one who has<br>
few beloved friends.<br>
Exile wraps him,<br>
not rings of gold,<br>
a frozen spirit,<br>
not the prosperity of the earth.<br>
He remembers hall-warriors<br>
and ring-givers,<br>
how his gold-giver<br>
treated him to feasting<br>
in his youth.<br>
How all that joy has died!<br>
And so he knows this,<br>
he who must for a long time<br>
forgo the counsel of his<br>
dear lord,<br>
when sorrow and sleep together<br>
wrap him up and bind him.<br>
He dreams in his head<br>
that he hugs and kisses<br>
his lord,<br>
and on his lord’s knee<br>
lie his hand and head,<br>
just as he, at times<br>
in days gone by,<br>
enjoyed the gift throne.<br>
Then he wakes back up<br>
a lordless man,<br>
he sees before him<br>
dusky waves,<br>
sea birds bathing,<br>
pruning their feathers,<br>
frost and snow falling,<br>
mixed in with hail.<br>
Then are that much heavier<br>
the wounds of his heart,<br>
grieving after his lord.<br>
His sorrow is renewed<br>
when his mind happens upon<br>
the memory of his kinsmen.<br>
He greets them with joy,<br>
eagerly looks over<br>
the gathering of men -<br>
but they always swim away.<br>
The journey of sailors<br>
never brings back many<br>
known stories.<br>
Grief is renewed<br>
for him who must<br>
always send his<br>
weary heart<br>
over the binding of the waves.</p>

<p>Therefore I can’t think<br>
why my heart does not<br>
darken when I reflect<br>
on all the lives of men<br>
throughout this world,<br>
how they suddenly<br>
left the hall floor,<br>
those proud thanes.<br>
So each day this Middle Earth<br>
crumbles and decays.<br>
Therefore a man cannot become<br>
wise before he has a share<br>
of winters in the world.<br>
A wise man must be patient,<br>
must not be too reckless,<br>
nor too word-hasty<br>
nor too weak a warrior,<br>
nor too rash,<br>
neither too fearful nor cheerful,<br>
nor too greedy of goods,<br>
and never too eager for boasting<br>
before he truly understands.<br>
A man must wait<br>
when he speaks oaths<br>
until the bold one<br>
truly knows<br>
where his heart’s intent<br>
will turn.<br>
A wise hero must realize<br>
how ghastly it will be<br>
when all the wealth of this world<br>
lies waste,<br>
as now in various places<br>
around this earth,<br>
walls stand<br>
blown by wind,<br>
covered in snow,<br>
storm-wrecked ruins.<br>
The halls decay,<br>
their leader lies dead,<br>
deprived of joy.<br>
The whole troop<br>
has proudly fallen by the wall.<br>
Some war took them,<br>
carried them on their way.<br>
One, a bird snatched off<br>
over the deep sea.<br>
Another, the grey wolf<br>
tore apart after his death.<br>
Another, buried<br>
dreary-faced<br>
in his grave.<br>
And so He destroyed this place,<br>
the Creator of men,<br>
until missing the noise<br>
of its residents,<br>
the old work of giants<br>
stood idle.</p>

<p>He who wisely reflected<br>
on this ruin,<br>
and deeply pondered<br>
this dark life,<br>
wise in experience,<br>
distantly remembered<br>
much slaying,<br>
and spoke these words:</p>

<p>Where is the horse? Where is the rider?<br>
Where is the treasure-giver?<br>
Where are the hall’s joys?<br>
Alas, the bright cups!<br>
Alas, the warrior in mail!<br>
How that time has departed,<br>
dark under night’s helm,<br>
as if it never were.<br>
Now stands as a trace of<br>
the dear warband<br>
a wonderously high wall,<br>
snakingly woven.<br>
The warriors have been snatched away<br>
by the honor of spears,<br>
slaughter-seeking weapons,<br>
that famous fate,<br>
and storms clash against<br>
these stone cliffs,<br>
falling frost<br>
grips the earth,<br>
the clamor of winter.<br>
Then darkness comes;<br>
night’s shadow deepens.<br>
From the north approaches<br>
a rough hail storm,<br>
hostile to men.<br>
All is troubled<br>
in this earthly kingdom,<br>
the tide of fate<br>
turns the world under the heavens.<br>
Here is wealth fleeting.<br>
Here are companions fleeting.<br>
Here is man himself fleeting.<br>
Here is kinsman fleeting.<br>
Every foundation of this world<br>
becomes void and vain.</p>

<p>So spoke the wise one in his mind.<br>
He sat apart in thought.<br>
Good is he who holds onto his faith,<br>
and a warrior must never speak<br>
the grievances of his heart too quickly,<br>
unless he already knows the cure.<br>
A hero must act with conviction.<br>
Good is he who seeks mercy,<br>
the Father’s grace in Heaven,<br>
where permanence stands for us all.</p>
