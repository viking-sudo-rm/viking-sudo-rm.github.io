      <title>The Wanderer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Often the outcast&lt;br /&gt;
awaits his grace,&lt;br /&gt;
the Lord&amp;rsquo;s mercy,&lt;br /&gt;
though he, sorrow-minded,&lt;br /&gt;
must turn his oars&lt;br /&gt;
along the waters,&lt;br /&gt;
wade the path of exile.&lt;br /&gt;
Fate goes always as it must!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So spoke the earth-stepper,&lt;br /&gt;
mindful of his misfortunes,&lt;br /&gt;
of wrathful slaughter,&lt;br /&gt;
the death of his comrades:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often in the morning,&lt;br /&gt;
I had to discuss&lt;br /&gt;
my every trouble alone.&lt;br /&gt;
There is no one living&lt;br /&gt;
that I dare open my innermost thought to.&lt;br /&gt;
Truly I know&lt;br /&gt;
that it ought to be among men,&lt;br /&gt;
the noble custom,&lt;br /&gt;
where one secures the chest of his spirit,&lt;br /&gt;
hordes his treasure case,&lt;br /&gt;
thinks and speaks freely.&lt;br /&gt;
The weary spirit cannot&lt;br /&gt;
withstand fate,&lt;br /&gt;
nor does the bitter mind&lt;br /&gt;
help do any good.&lt;br /&gt;
So the glory-yearning&lt;br /&gt;
often lock away their dreary&lt;br /&gt;
thoughts in their breast-coffins.&lt;br /&gt;
So I,&lt;br /&gt;
often wretched&lt;br /&gt;
and besorrowed,&lt;br /&gt;
have had to seal away&lt;br /&gt;
my thoughts from kinsmen,&lt;br /&gt;
since, long ago,&lt;br /&gt;
I sealed my lord&lt;br /&gt;
in the darkness of the earth&lt;br /&gt;
and from there travelled&lt;br /&gt;
winter-minded&lt;br /&gt;
over the frozen waves,&lt;br /&gt;
sought, hall-lacking,&lt;br /&gt;
a treasure-giver,&lt;br /&gt;
wherever far or near&lt;br /&gt;
I might find someone&lt;br /&gt;
in the meadhall&lt;br /&gt;
who knew me,&lt;br /&gt;
or was willing to console&lt;br /&gt;
me, the friendless one,&lt;br /&gt;
wow me with wonders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He who has known it understands&lt;br /&gt;
how cruel sorrow is as a companion&lt;br /&gt;
for the one who has&lt;br /&gt;
few beloved friends.&lt;br /&gt;
Exile wraps him,&lt;br /&gt;
not rings of gold,&lt;br /&gt;
a frozen spirit,&lt;br /&gt;
not the prosperity of the earth.&lt;br /&gt;
He remembers hall-warriors&lt;br /&gt;
and ring-givers,&lt;br /&gt;
how his gold-giver&lt;br /&gt;
treated him to feasting&lt;br /&gt;
in his youth.&lt;br /&gt;
How all that joy has died!&lt;br /&gt;
And so he knows this,&lt;br /&gt;
he who must for a long time&lt;br /&gt;
forgo the counsel of his&lt;br /&gt;
dear lord,&lt;br /&gt;
when sorrow and sleep together&lt;br /&gt;
wrap him up and bind him.&lt;br /&gt;
He dreams in his head&lt;br /&gt;
that he hugs and kisses&lt;br /&gt;
his lord,&lt;br /&gt;
and on his lord&amp;rsquo;s knee&lt;br /&gt;
lie his hand and head,&lt;br /&gt;
just as he, at times&lt;br /&gt;
in days gone by,&lt;br /&gt;
enjoyed the gift throne.&lt;br /&gt;
Then he wakes back up&lt;br /&gt;
a lordless man,&lt;br /&gt;
he sees before him&lt;br /&gt;
dusky waves,&lt;br /&gt;
sea birds bathing,&lt;br /&gt;
pruning their feathers,&lt;br /&gt;
frost and snow falling,&lt;br /&gt;
mixed in with hail.&lt;br /&gt;
Then are that much heavier&lt;br /&gt;
the wounds of his heart,&lt;br /&gt;
grieving after his lord.&lt;br /&gt;
His sorrow is renewed&lt;br /&gt;
when his mind happens upon&lt;br /&gt;
the memory of his kinsmen.&lt;br /&gt;
He greets them with joy,&lt;br /&gt;
eagerly looks over&lt;br /&gt;
the gathering of men -&lt;br /&gt;
but they always swim away.&lt;br /&gt;
The journey of sailors&lt;br /&gt;
never brings back many&lt;br /&gt;
known stories.&lt;br /&gt;
Grief is renewed&lt;br /&gt;
for him who must&lt;br /&gt;
always send his&lt;br /&gt;
weary heart&lt;br /&gt;
over the binding of the waves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore I can&amp;rsquo;t think&lt;br /&gt;
why my heart does not&lt;br /&gt;
darken when I reflect&lt;br /&gt;
on all the lives of men&lt;br /&gt;
throughout this world,&lt;br /&gt;
how they suddenly&lt;br /&gt;
left the hall floor,&lt;br /&gt;
those proud thanes.&lt;br /&gt;
So each day this Middle Earth&lt;br /&gt;
crumbles and decays.&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore a man cannot become&lt;br /&gt;
wise before he has a share&lt;br /&gt;
of winters in the world.&lt;br /&gt;
A wise man must be patient,&lt;br /&gt;
must not be too reckless,&lt;br /&gt;
nor too word-hasty&lt;br /&gt;
nor too weak a warrior,&lt;br /&gt;
nor too rash,&lt;br /&gt;
neither too fearful nor cheerful,&lt;br /&gt;
nor too greedy of goods,&lt;br /&gt;
and never too eager for boasting&lt;br /&gt;
before he truly understands.&lt;br /&gt;
A man must wait&lt;br /&gt;
when he speaks oaths&lt;br /&gt;
until the bold one&lt;br /&gt;
truly knows&lt;br /&gt;
where his heart&amp;rsquo;s intent&lt;br /&gt;
will turn.&lt;br /&gt;
A wise hero must realize&lt;br /&gt;
how ghastly it will be&lt;br /&gt;
when all the wealth of this world&lt;br /&gt;
lies waste,&lt;br /&gt;
as now in various places&lt;br /&gt;
around this earth,&lt;br /&gt;
walls stand&lt;br /&gt;
blown by wind,&lt;br /&gt;
covered in snow,&lt;br /&gt;
storm-wrecked ruins.&lt;br /&gt;
The halls decay,&lt;br /&gt;
their leader lies dead,&lt;br /&gt;
deprived of joy.&lt;br /&gt;
The whole troop&lt;br /&gt;
has proudly fallen by the wall.&lt;br /&gt;
Some war took them,&lt;br /&gt;
carried them on their way.&lt;br /&gt;
One, a bird snatched off&lt;br /&gt;
over the deep sea.&lt;br /&gt;
Another, the grey wolf&lt;br /&gt;
tore apart after his death.&lt;br /&gt;
Another, buried&lt;br /&gt;
dreary-faced&lt;br /&gt;
in his grave.&lt;br /&gt;
And so He destroyed this place,&lt;br /&gt;
the Creator of men,&lt;br /&gt;
until missing the noise&lt;br /&gt;
of its residents,&lt;br /&gt;
the old work of giants&lt;br /&gt;
stood idle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He who wisely reflected&lt;br /&gt;
on this ruin,&lt;br /&gt;
and deeply pondered&lt;br /&gt;
this dark life,&lt;br /&gt;
wise in experience,&lt;br /&gt;
distantly remembered&lt;br /&gt;
much slaying,&lt;br /&gt;
and spoke these words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where is the horse? Where is the rider?&lt;br /&gt;
Where is the treasure-giver?&lt;br /&gt;
Where are the hall&amp;rsquo;s joys?&lt;br /&gt;
Alas, the bright cups!&lt;br /&gt;
Alas, the warrior in mail!&lt;br /&gt;
How that time has departed,&lt;br /&gt;
dark under night&amp;rsquo;s helm,&lt;br /&gt;
as if it never were.&lt;br /&gt;
Now stands as a trace of&lt;br /&gt;
the dear warband&lt;br /&gt;
a wonderously high wall,&lt;br /&gt;
snakingly woven.&lt;br /&gt;
The warriors have been snatched away&lt;br /&gt;
by the honor of spears,&lt;br /&gt;
slaughter-seeking weapons,&lt;br /&gt;
that famous fate,&lt;br /&gt;
and storms clash against&lt;br /&gt;
these stone cliffs,&lt;br /&gt;
falling frost&lt;br /&gt;
grips the earth,&lt;br /&gt;
the clamor of winter.&lt;br /&gt;
Then darkness comes;&lt;br /&gt;
night&amp;rsquo;s shadow deepens.&lt;br /&gt;
From the north approaches&lt;br /&gt;
a rough hail storm,&lt;br /&gt;
hostile to men.&lt;br /&gt;
All is troubled&lt;br /&gt;
in this earthly kingdom,&lt;br /&gt;
the tide of fate&lt;br /&gt;
turns the world under the heavens.&lt;br /&gt;
Here is wealth fleeting.&lt;br /&gt;
Here are companions fleeting.&lt;br /&gt;
Here is man himself fleeting.&lt;br /&gt;
Here is kinsman fleeting.&lt;br /&gt;
Every foundation of this world&lt;br /&gt;
becomes void and vain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So spoke the wise one in his mind.&lt;br /&gt;
He sat apart in thought.&lt;br /&gt;
Good is he who holds onto his faith,&lt;br /&gt;
and a warrior must never speak&lt;br /&gt;
the grievances of his heart too quickly,&lt;br /&gt;
unless he already knows the cure.&lt;br /&gt;
A hero must act with conviction.&lt;br /&gt;
Good is he who seeks mercy,&lt;br /&gt;
the Father&amp;rsquo;s grace in Heaven,&lt;br /&gt;
where permanence stands for us all.&lt;/p&gt;
